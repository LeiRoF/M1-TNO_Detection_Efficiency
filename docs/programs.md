# Programs

This project contain 2 main programs :

## serialize.py

This program will inspect all the raw data and serialize them. It only need to be executed once for a given data set. It will automatically save all the serialized data in JSON files in the `data` folder. On the main repo of this project, the initial data are already available in a JSON format. These file are needed to use the second program. You can adapt this program to your own data by editing the functions listed in the file `interface.py`.

## train_ai.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file is the heart of the project, where you can perform some tests on the AI.
